Eligible candidates who want to pursue PhD are STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to apply for The Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS). HKPFS provides a highly competitive package to the recipients, including a monthly stipend of 25,000 HKD, tuition & fee waiver, and a travel grant.
 	
I am looking for prospective PhD students who are interested in research in the area of transportation systems engineering. Preferences will be given to those who have strong motivation for PhD study, backgrounds in operations research/applied mathematics/transportation engineering, or good English competency. The normal duration of PhD study is 3 years for candidates who hold master degrees, and 4 years for those who have bachelor degrees only. Students with interest should send their resume and transcripts to me at weihua.gu@polyu.edu.hk.
