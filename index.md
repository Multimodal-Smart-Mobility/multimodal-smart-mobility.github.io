# About Us

Multimodal Smart Mobility (MSM) focuses on public transportation systems, multimodal urban transportation systems, traffic operations, queueing models, infrastructure management, electric vehicles, and maritime transportation. We are especially interested in how various transportation modes including cars, buses, rail, and bicycles interact in urban networks, and how to optimally design and manage such a multimodal urban transportation system for the benefit of all.
