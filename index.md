# About Us

The Multimodal Smart Mobility (MSM) Lab is dedicated to developing smart and forward-thinking solutions for urban transportation. Our research focuses on the complex interactions between various modes—including cars, buses, rail, and bicycles—within city networks. We aim to optimally design and manage these integrated systems through rigorous analysis in areas such as public transit operations, traffic network control, queueing theory, infrastructure management, and new energy vehicles. Our ultimate goal is to create more efficient, sustainable, and equitable mobility for all.
