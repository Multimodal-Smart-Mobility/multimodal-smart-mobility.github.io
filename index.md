# About Us

The Multimodal Smart Mobility (MSM) Lab is dedicated to developing smart and forward-thinking solutions for urban transportation. Our research focuses on the complex interactions between various modes—including cars, buses, rail, and bicycles—within city networks. We aim to optimally design and manage these integrated systems through rigorous analysis in areas such as public transit operations, traffic network control, queueing theory, infrastructure management, and new energy vehicles. Our ultimate goal is to create more efficient, sustainable, and equitable mobility for all.

# Join Us
Eligible candidates who want to pursue PhD are STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to apply for The Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS). HKPFS provides a highly competitive package to the recipients, including a monthly stipend of 25,000 HKD, tuition & fee waiver, and a travel grant.
 	
I am looking for prospective PhD students who are interested in research in the area of transportation systems engineering. Preferences will be given to those who have strong motivation for PhD study, backgrounds in operations research/applied mathematics/transportation engineering, or good English competency. The normal duration of PhD study is 3 years for candidates who hold master degrees, and 4 years for those who have bachelor degrees only. Students with interest should send their resume and transcripts to me at weihua.gu@polyu.edu.hk.
