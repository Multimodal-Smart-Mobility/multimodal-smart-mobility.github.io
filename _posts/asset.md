title: Asset Management
---

	

We consider a class of resource allocation problems that apply to optimal management of transportation infrastructure systems and other assets, e.g. vehicle fleets. These problems are common in that the infrastructure will deteriorate and the assets will age over time. Maintenance (including rehabilitation) activities can defer the deterioration and aging process, while replacement/reconstruction can renew the asset. We solve these optimization problems of different application types at various complexity levels (e.g., for a single facility and for a network of facilities). We are also studying optimal ways of deploying and operating infrastructure and assets for the next generation transportation systems (e.g. electric vehicles used as taxis, buses, or private cars).
