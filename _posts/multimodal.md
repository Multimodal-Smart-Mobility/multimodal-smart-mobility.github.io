We explore how the interactions between traffic streams of different modes affect the overall system performance, and how the negative impacts can be mitigated via smart strategies.

 	

Near-side/far-side bus stops

 	

Dwelling bus at a curbside stop can become a bottleneck for cars. When this temporary bottleneck interacts with a nearby traffic signal, the combined effect can be worse: both bus and car delays can increase.

 	

 	

Which location is better? There has long been debates...

 	

Our Key Findings:

For both types of stops, both bus and car delays decrease as the distance between stop and intersection increases.
Near-side stops in general induce less cars delays than far-side ones; while far-side stops induce less bus delays.
 	
We developed strategies for mitigating car queues and bus delays. These include bus holding and dynamic signal control. We find that holding can significantly reduce car delays, and dynamic signal control can reduce bus delays as well.

 	

 	

 	

Methodology: LWR theory. (For more details, see http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trb.2012.09.005 and http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trb.2014.06.001.) A related study employed the variational theory to estimate the capacity reduction caused by an obstruction near a signalized intersection: http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21680566.2015.1052111.

Access points of freeway special lanes

 	

Freeways with special lanes (e.g. HOV or toll lanes) are another case where multiple traffic streams (e.g. carpool vehicles and regular vehicles) interact. The special lanes are usually physically separated from the adjacent regular-use lanes to reduce the so-called "frictional effect" between traffic streams. This limited-access special lanes were found to create traffic bottlenecks near the access points.

 	

 	

We analyzed detector and video data collected from three real sites of special-lane access points, and developed and calibrated simulation to test strategies for mitigating the negative impacts of those access points.

 	

Key Findings:

Access points can become damaging bottlenecks for both the special lane and regular lanes.
Activating the special lanes in rush periods only would add more damages to the traffic.
Ways to alleviate the damages include: elongating the access points, and segregating ingress from egress via tandem openings. However, these cannot eliminate the problem.
The best way we tested is to completely remove the physical buffer between the special lane and regular lanes, i.e., to convert the limited-access lane to a non-separated one.

Traffic coordination at signalized intersections via pre-signals

 	

Mid-block pre-signal can increase vehicle discharge capacity at signalized intersections.

 	

 	

We employ the pre-signal to compensate the car capacity lost to bus priority measures at intersections, including a dedicated bus lane and Transit Signal Priority (TSP).

 	

 	

The main signal and pre-signal are coordinated such that: i) the cycle length remains unchanged; and ii) the capacity for cross-street traffic is not compromised.

 	

 	

Key Findings:

Both bus and car operations are improved significantly.
The strategy is especially advantageous for bus intersections where bus and car flows are both high.

Ongoing Work: We are currently exploring more efficient signal priority schemes and intermittent bus lane strategies that are applied to more general scenarios including left-turning buses and narrow intersections (e.g., intersection approaches with two lanes only).
