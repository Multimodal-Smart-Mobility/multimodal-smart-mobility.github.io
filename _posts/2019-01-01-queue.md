We studied a special type of vehicle queues where servers are laid out in serial fashion, and overtaking maneuvers are often constrained or prohibited. Examples include bus stops, checkpoints (e.g. toll stations) with tandem booths, Passenger Rapid Transit systems, and passenger queues boarding airplanes. 	

*Bus queues at multi-berth stops 	

Long bus queues are prevailing in many cities over the world.

Bus queueing behavior at multi-berth stops is different from classical queueing systems with parallel servers; see the following figure.

*Key Findings:

Capacity formulas in prevailing manuals (e.g. Highway Capacity Manual) were wrong.
Dwell time variation is detrimental.
Splitting a large stop is often beneficial. (For more details, see <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trb.2011.01.001>)
Allowing bus overtaking maneuvers does NOT always bring benefit. (See why: <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trb.2013.08.005>)
Adding buffers between servers can improve system capacity. This strategy can be applied to another type of queueing systems with tandem servers - tandem toll booths. (See <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trb.2012.08.006>)


*Methodology: 

Renewal Theory and discrete-event simulation. (See details from <http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/trsc.2014.0537>)

*Ongoing work: 

We are currently exploring real-world bus stops with more complicated driver behavior, nearby traffic signals and general-purpose traffic, and congested bus corridors. We are also examining better policies for loading passengers to a commercial flight.
